= What is SeeVolution? =

SeeVolution provides an easy to use behavioral analytics and monitoring tool that allows users to monitor activity and click paths in real-time. Rather than navigating away from a website to analyze visitor trends, once logged in to SeeVolution, users see a movable, live traffic feed that lays transparently over the page users are tracking.

Separate Click and Scroll Heatmaps break down the user interaction with the web page and provide a narrative for how individual visitor sessions take place.
